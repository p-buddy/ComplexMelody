# ComplexMelody
This is a work in progress.

I'm making an app to allow the user to write melodies using a sequence of complex number products (specifically, I map notes to a circle and then let the user describe how to stop at different points along that circle as described by complex number multiplication).

This is an effort to make web apps that task the user with learning some STEM related concept, not for the sake of learning it, but for the sake of being able to express their creativity.
